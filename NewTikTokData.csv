file1-Fake.mp4,fake,news Disneyworld officially removed the drinking age in their Parks this means that anyone regardless of age can legally drink at Disney World this comes after a year-long battle with the state of Florida to get a resort exemption originally Disney was attempting to lower the drinking age to 18 however they ended up removing the drinking age all together Disney is doing this to make more money but it is proving to be very controversial the biggest concern is over people drunk driving but Disney has an ingenious solution to prevent that they will require guests under 21 to wear a special magic band that can only be removed by  nikesh members at the park exit however in order to get the Magic Band removed you must have a blood alcohol level below .02 if someone is unable to blow less than 0.02 Disney will take the guests home in a minivan however according to an official spokesperson guess who need the money man service should expect prices to be double or triple what an Uber or Lyft would cost to get them home upon dropping the guests off the Disney minivan driver will remove the special magic button and send you on your way according to experts this change is a huge win for Disney for more information click the link in our bio or visit mousetrap news.com  cam

file3-Fake.mp4,fake,how bad is 5G for your health while you're here in horror stories but these are the reality you are putting your future at risk using 5G voluntarily the first thing I do when I get my phone is go to the settings and turn off 5G it doesn't change the value the phone any way shape or form to me and it also is saving my health at night get the phone away from you put it on airplane mode or turn it off this time is to restore and recover and you cannot do it with your cell phone on and your Wi-Fi on while you sleep
file4-Fake.mp4,fake,so 5G technology if you notice before they put up the towers it was a huge multi billion dollar marketing campaign everywhere you turn on radio or TV it was non-stop ads 45 G 5G it's going to be blazing fast internet going to change our lives the whole world is going to run on 5G download speeds blah blah blah download a movie in three seconds all this bullshit is any of y'all's internet  faster than it was before  it's worse than it was before glitchy slow constant problems so do you really believe 5G was for your internet speeds
file5-Fake.mp4,fake,so if you think this is going to be no big deal you're absolutely wrong the reason they're going to create this Panic is to force us to our knees to make us so uncomfortable and panic that will say yes we'll take the digital just get the money turned back on so life can go back to normal that's what the whole shutdown is for and of course they're going to blame it on the bankers he's evil Bankers came in and stole your money they're just doing the bankers are just doing what they're told okay so but they have  to create the crisis so they can ride in and save the day so they shut down the money on a Friday within three weeks to three months I don't think it'll take three months because we're so soft here we're not used to hardship and doing without here we're used to just run into the store anytime we need something so once they shut all that off and people are out of money and people are starting to starve most people would just give in willingly quick so I don't think it's going to take three months I think 32 maybe six weeks tops  but I would prepare for three months if I was you
file6-Real.mp4,real,is 5G dangerous the general consensus is no here's why we're talking about electromagnetic radiation and electromagnetic fields this is what people mean when they bring up EMF the reason people are worried in general relates to fears around radiation at high levels which is a completely normal concern but we're talking about the frequency range of x-rays UV rays gamma radiation things that we know are harmful and these are from the high end of the electromagnetic spectrum  spectrum because that's what we're talking about here light electromagnetic radiation that we can modulate to send messages to each other we've used this method of communication since the first radio was invented in 1895 by Guglielmo Marconi and that's what 5G is it's a frequency of radio waves that we can use to communicate it's at the lower end of the electromagnetic spectrum now the radio spectrum runs from about one Hertz to three thousand Giga Hertz  and 5 gigahertz is the highest frequency of radio waves that we've been able to use so far now this higher frequency of radio wave allows us to transmit more data faster but the most important thing to know here is that these are non ionizing electromagnetic fields so they are not hazardous to your health the non-ionizing frequencies run all the way through the visible portion of the spectrum now in order for an electromagnetic field to be dangerous it needs to be an ion  sizing field and this happens at frequencies of around 3 million gigahertz think about that 5 gigahertz 23 million gigahertz this is why we need sunscreen to protect us from UV radiation screens when were using X-rays and Y gamma radiation while an excellent tool in treating cancer is also extremely dangerous to help the cells but 5G radio waves have such a low wavelength that they do not penetrate the body  5G is non-ionizing and at a lower frequency than the light that we interact with every moment of every day now it's true that some papers question the long-term effects but they're wondering about long-term effects of Technology particularly in built-up areas and wondering how this will affect us over time which is a valid question but it is a valid question of all technology of all or methods of communication new technology will always raise questions but the science is clear the frequency range is a  a few million GHz off being dangerous
