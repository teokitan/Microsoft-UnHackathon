       " \"information it's game on for everyone at first it was just random rumors about the to dating but then it got a lot more intense after Taylor started showing up to Travis's games and she didn't even show up alone she was always with his mom in the VIP section of the audience cheering for her boyfriend it's kind of a high school sweetheart love story and we are here for it now there was a lot of mystery around the too because a low we all knew something was going on we weren't sure we didn't want to make any assumptions  and they could have been just really good friends right but turns out that wasn't what was going on sources reveal the completely different story one that we liked a lot more Taylor and Travis after staying silent for so long finally broke their silence and publicly announced their love for each other some fans think that she might be taking things too fast but we think she's doing what's best for her and for that we could not have been happier the couple was recently spotted holding hands and having a romantic PDA filled date night after an SNL show  and guys it was the most adorable thing ever we are going to talk about that and much more in today's video Welcome Back to the celebrity buzz and today we are going to be talking about how Taylor Swift announced that she is dating Travis Kelce publicly but before we get to talking about all that make sure to give this video I'm sure so Taylor and Travis have allegedly been going out for a while now Taylor was actually in a long-term relationship before she got with for the fandom but we saw our queen move on after  after her breakup she was rumoured to be dating a lot of different people but it turns out all of them were just flings and rebounds until mr. Travis Kelce showed up and everything changed he literally helped her get over all the gloom and sadness and showed her a brighter side of life so in order for you guys to understand why we're so excited about this whole thing you'll need to have the context of this relationship but don't worry you won't have to watch a bunch of videos for that because we're going to give you a little recap right  so it started out with one interview that Travis did it wasn't even something serious word got out that he went to a Taylor Swift concert now this shouldn't have been a big deal and it wasn't but then he was asked about it in an interview and he revealed some very interesting things in the interview Travis said that he loved Taylor and her music and went to one of her concerts but that wasn't the shocking part he also said that he made her a friendship bracelet for her with his own personal number on it one of the bracelets  it's I made for you made our bracelet yeah if you're up on Taylor Swift concerts there are friendship bracelets and I received a bunch of them being there but I wanted to give Taylor Swift 21 with my number on it now right now your numbers in 87 or your phone number yeah you know which one but unfortunately he wasn't able to give it to her being a Taylor Swift I know you went to the chest of clouds or how was it yeah well I was disappointed that she doesn't talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings now  interview started going viral and people started shipping them instantly according to Insider sources Taylor reached out to Travis after that and connected with him after that the two started casually hanging out and getting to know each other it wasn't anything serious and they didn't think it would go anywhere but the to instantly clicked and decided to go on more dates but hold on a minute before we get on with today's video and give you the rest of the Saucy details do us a favor and make sure to share this video with a friend who  might enjoy our content and turn on post notifications while you're at it too so you don't miss out on any of our future uploads now this is where the story gets spicy Taylor decided to show up to one of Travis's games now that's nothing big right was there casually hanging out with Travis's mom yep you heard that right the two were seen cheering every time Travis scored in just having the time of their lives even Travis talked about it saying that his mom had a really good time with Taylor\",\n",

       " \"is 5G dangerous the general consensus is no here's why we're talking about electromagnetic radiation and electromagnetic fields this is what people mean when they bring up EMF the reason people are worried in general relates to fears around radiation at high levels which is a completely normal concern but we're talking about the frequency range of x-rays UV rays gamma radiation things that we know are harmful and these are from the high end of the electromagnetic spectrum  spectrum because that's what we're talking about here light electromagnetic radiation that we can modulate to send messages to each other we've used this method of communication since the first radio was invented in 1895 by Guglielmo Marconi and that's what 5G is it's a frequency of radio waves that we can use to communicate it's at the lower end of the electromagnetic spectrum now the radio spectrum runs from about one Hertz to three thousand Giga Hertz  and 5 gigahertz is the highest frequency of radio waves that we've been able to use so far now this higher frequency of radio wave allows us to transmit more data faster but the most important thing to know here is that these are non ionizing electromagnetic fields so they are not hazardous to your health the non-ionizing frequencies run all the way through the visible portion of the spectrum now in order for an electromagnetic field to be dangerous it needs to be an ion  sizing field and this happens at frequencies of around 3 million gigahertz think about that 5 gigahertz 23 million gigahertz this is why we need sunscreen to protect us from UV radiation screens when were using X-rays and Y gamma radiation while an excellent tool in treating cancer is also extremely dangerous to help the cells but 5G radio waves have such a low wavelength that they do not penetrate the body  5G is non-ionizing and at a lower frequency than the light that we interact with every moment of every day now it's true that some papers question the long-term effects but they're wondering about long-term effects of Technology particularly in built-up areas and wondering how this will affect us over time which is a valid question but it is a valid question of all technology of all or methods of communication new technology will always raise questions but the science is clear the frequency range is a  a few million GHz off being dangerous\",\n",
